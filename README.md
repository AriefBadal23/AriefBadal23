### About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m Arief.I'm am an software development student at Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences. My journey into software development began in 2021, and ever since, I've been dedicated to learning the key technologies that define this field.

ðŸ’» Iâ€™ve worked with Python, C#, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Django. I also have experience with tools like Docker. Throughout this journey, Iâ€™ve built and contributed to projects that reflect my growing expertise.

ðŸš€ My main focus is on backend development, but Iâ€™m equally comfortable working on frontend tasks when needed. Iâ€™m always exploring new technologies and seeking out opportunities to expand my skill set.

Feel free to explore the projects on my profile.
